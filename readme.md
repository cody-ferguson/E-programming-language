# E programming language
The E programming language is meant for educational purpose and to fix a misconception that programming languages are hard to make.
It is not meant to be taken seriously, but feel free to suggest features anytime.

The E programming language is built off node.js and currently requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run.<br>
This will not be the case in the future, but for now, I will not be releasing binaries for this just because features will be added so frequently. 
Feel free to download the source code and make your own binaries, but please don't release them.
